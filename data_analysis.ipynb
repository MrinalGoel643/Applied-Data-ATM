    "- Predict: Will they pay back within 30 days?\n",
    "- Measure: `repaid_full_30d` (True/False)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1: Start with one loan**\n",
    "- Look at the ADVANCES table\n",
    "- Pick one row = one loan to predict\n",
    "- Example: User wants to borrow $25 on March 22\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1a: Check if this is their FIRST loan**\n",
    "- Count how many loans this `user_id` has in ADVANCES table\n",
    "- Filter: Only keep loans where this is the user's FIRST advance\n",
    "- Skip this loan if they've borrowed before\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2: Find out what happened (30-day repayment) **\n",
    "- Go to LABELS table\n",
    "- Match: `labels.advance_id` = `advances.request_id`\n",
    "- Look at: `repaid_full_30d` (True/False)\n",
    "- This tells you: Did they pay back FULLY within 30 days?\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3: Find the person**\n",
    "- Get the `user_id` from the advances table\n",
    "- Now you know WHO borrowed the money\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 4: Look at their spending history**\n",
    "- Go to TRANSACTIONS table\n",
    "- Find all rows with this `user_id`\n",
    "- **IMPORTANT:** Only use transactions from BEFORE the loan date\n",
    "- Count: How many times did they spend money?\n",
    "- Calculate: What's their average spending?\n",
    "- Look: What do they buy? (groceries, loan payments, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 5: Check their bank balance**\n",
    "- Go to BALANCES table\n",
    "- Find all rows with this `user_id`\n",
    "- **IMPORTANT:** Only use balances from BEFORE the loan date\n",
    "- Get the most recent balance\n",
    "- Check: Is their balance positive or negative?\n",
    "- See: Is their balance going up or down over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 6: Put it all together**\n",
    "- Combine all the information for this one FIRST-TIME loan:\n",
    "  - This is their first loan: Yes\n",
    "  - Loan amount: $25\n",
    "  - Their balance: $63\n",
    "  - Number of transactions: 491\n",
    "  - They pay other loans: Yes\n",
    "  - Balance is positive: Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 7: Make a prediction**\n",
    "- Predict: Will they pay back FULLY within 30 days?\n",
    "- Then check `repaid_full_30d` in LABELS to see if you were right!\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 8: Measure precision**\n",
    "- For all first-time loans you predicted \"Yes, they'll pay back\":\n",
    "  - Count how many actually paid back (True Positives)\n",
    "  - Count how many did NOT pay back (False Positives)\n",
